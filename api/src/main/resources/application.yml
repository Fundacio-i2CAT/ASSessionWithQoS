  # A string used to indicate the features supported by an API that is used as defined in clause 6.6 in 3GPP TS 29.500. 
  # The string shall contain a bitmask indicating supported features in hexadecimal representation Each character in the string shall take a value of "0" to "9", "a" to "f" or "A" to "F" and shall represent the support of 4 features as described in tableÂ 5.2.2-3.
  # The most significant character representing the highest-numbered features shall appear first in the string, and the character representing features 1 to 4 shall appear last in the string. The list of features and their numbering (starting with 1) are defined separately for each API.
  # If the string contains a lower number of characters than there are defined features for an API, all features that would be represented by characters that are not present in the string are not supported
  #
  # It looks like the features supported by Open5gs are the following. 
  # OGS_SBI_NPCF_POLICYAUTHORIZATION_IMS_SBI -> 5
  # OGS_SBI_NPCF_POLICYAUTHORIZATION_SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY -> 2
  # The bitmask: 00010010 --> 0x12
